    <h1>Art</h1>
    <p>Art is a diverse range of human activity and its resulting product that involves creative or imaginative talent generally 
        expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas.[1][2][3]
        There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art,[4][5][6] and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout
         history and across cultures. In the Western tradition, the three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture,
          and architecture.[7] Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other media such
           as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of the arts.[1][8] Until the 17th century, art referred to any
            skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic
             considerations are paramount,
         the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.</p>
